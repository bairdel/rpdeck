Current intentions is for a python script to run on raspberry pi startup. 
Would like a backup battery with main intentions to be ran with mains power. 
Either touchscreen functionality, or buttons (similar to game controller). Possibly an e-ink display. 

Rotating circle of modules: 

- minecraft server
  -  button for on, off
  - uptime + refresh button
  - ip, post, shown. etc
- writing
  - file format that can be edited offline but saves to google docs
  - very basic text editor
- music / video library
  - possibly use plex
- pihole
  - show logs and speeds? 
  - on/off button
- notion
  - show daily goals
  - possibly a web link?
